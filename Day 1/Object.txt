Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

Objects : 
    An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association of a key and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
    In Javascript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. In addition to obejcts that are predefined in the browser, we can define our own objects.
    We can change the key's value by using by accesing it 
        objectName[key] = newValue;
    the above code changes the value for particular key.
